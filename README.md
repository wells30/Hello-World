# Hello-World
For IT 252
When I was two or three, my dad bought a new car. He was driving down a muddy hill after a rain storm when our brand new Chevy Impala began to slide into a tree. My cousin Randy was with us, he's six years older than me, along with my mom and papaw. Dad couldn't swear since his dad was in the car but I'm sure there were many words going through his mind.
